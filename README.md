# Uncovering-Insights-from-Adidas-Sales-Data
This project explores Adidasâ€™ U.S. sales data to uncover key performance drivers across product categories, regions, retailers, and sales channels. Using Excel (PivotTables, charts, and slicers), I analyzed  transactions to identify sales patterns, top-performing products, and seasonal trends.
##  Introduction

Adidas, one of the worldâ€™s leading sportswear brands, collects detailed sales data across its U.S. operations - spanning multiple retailers, regions, and product categories. This dataset includes daily transaction records capturing:

- Product type  
- Number of units sold  
- Revenue  
- Profit  
- Sales channels (in-store, online, outlet)  

By diving into this rich dataset, I set out to uncover whatâ€™s driving Adidasâ€™ performance - from high-performing products and regions to evaluating which sales methods deliver the most value.

This analysis reveals where strategic improvements and marketing efforts could make the biggest impact.
##  Objectives

To achieve the goal of identifying growth opportunities and improving profitability, this project is guided by the following specific objectives:

- **Analyze Product Performance**  
  Evaluate total revenue, units sold, and profit by product category to identify high-performing and underperforming product lines.

- **Compare Sales Methods**  
  Analyze in-store, online, and outlet sales channels to understand consumer behavior and assess the effectiveness of each channel.

- **Detect Seasonal or Monthly Trends**  
  Examine sales over time to uncover patterns that can support demand forecasting, inventory planning, and marketing campaigns.

- **Provide Actionable Recommendations**  
  Translate data findings into clear business insights that can guide Adidas in optimizing its sales strategy for improved profitability.

##  Observations

- **Top Products**:  
  Menâ€™s Street Footwear led in both total sales ($208M+) and operating margin (45%), making it the most valuable product line. Womenâ€™s Apparel also performed strongly with $179M+ in sales and a 44% margin.

- **Top Retailers**:  
  West Gear and Footlocker emerged as the highest-performing retail partners, contributing significantly to Adidasâ€™ revenue â€” emphasizing the value of strong retail relationships.

- **Regional Performance**:  
  The **Western region** generated the highest total sales ($269M+), followed by the **Northeast** and **Southeast**, highlighting regional differences in demand and store effectiveness.

- **Top Cities**:  
  Charleston and New York reported the highest sales volumes, indicating strong customer activity and/or highly effective retail locations in these cities.

- **Sales Channels**:  
  In-store purchases accounted for **39.6%** of total sales, outperforming outlets (32.8%) and online sales (27.5%). Physical stores remain the leading revenue channel.

- **Seasonality Trends**:  
  Sales spiked in **December**, likely due to holiday shopping, while **July and August** recorded the highest monthly sales â€” possibly tied to summer promotions and back-to-school
campaigns.
##  Recommendations

- **Double Down on High Performers**  
  Focus inventory, promotions, and new launches around top-performing products like *Menâ€™s Street Footwear* and *Womenâ€™s Apparel*. These categories show both high sales and strong margins â€” making them key revenue drivers.

- **Strengthen Retail Partnerships**  
  Retailers like *West Gear* and *Footlocker* are crucial to Adidasâ€™ performance. Explore exclusive deals, improved margins, or co-branded marketing campaigns with these partners to boost sales further.

- **Expand in High-Performing Regions**  
  With the *Western region*, *Charleston*, and *New York* leading in sales, consider opening more stores, launching pop-ups, or increasing marketing efforts in these locations to gain additional market share.

- **Enhance In-Store Experience**  
  Since in-store purchases remain dominant, invest in improving the in-store customer journey â€” while also working to upgrade online and outlet experiences to meet evolving consumer expectations.

- **Leverage Seasonal Spikes**  
  Capitalize on sales surges in *December*, *July*, and *August* with targeted campaigns or limited product drops. Align promotions with holiday and back-to-school periods for maximum impact.

- **Address Underperformance**  
  Investigate underperforming products or regions (e.g., the *Midwest*) and adjust pricing strategies, promotional efforts, or product assortments to improve returns.

- **Implement Real-Time Analytics**  
  Adopt dashboard tools and real-time reporting systems to help leadership monitor performance, make quicker decisions, and execute data-driven strategies with agility.
